Problem Statement: Kanban System for a Distributed Software Development Team

A rapidly growing software development company,
"InnovateTech,"
is struggling with coordinating tasks and maintaining visibility
across its geographically distributed teams.
They currently use a combination of spreadsheets 
and ad-hoc communication,
leading to missed deadlines, 
duplicated efforts,
and a lack of transparency regarding project progress.
