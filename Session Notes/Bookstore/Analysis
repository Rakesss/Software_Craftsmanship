Design a system for managing a simple online bookstore. 
Users can browse books, add them to a shopping cart, 
and place orders. Each book has a title, author, price, and a BookGenre 
(e.g., FICTION, SCIENCE, HISTORY, PROGRAMMING).
The system should allow tracking of order status (e.g., PENDING, SHIPPED, DELIVERED, CANCELED).
