1. Implicit Typecasting (Automatic Type Conversion)
Done automatically by the compiler.

Occurs when converting a smaller data type to a larger data type.

No data loss occurs.

Common in arithmetic expressions.


2. Explicit Typecasting (Manual Type Conversion)
Done manually by the programmer using a cast operator.

Used when you need to force conversion, often from a larger data type to a smaller one.

Might lead to data loss or unexpected results
