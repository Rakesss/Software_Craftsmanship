                                        DDD

Domain Driven Development: It is an approach in software development 
that centres on modelling the real-world domain of a problem statement 
and building the software that reflects it.

In DDD, the domain model becomes the backbone of the system. 
The code and design are driven by this model using "ubiquitous language".
